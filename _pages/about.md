I am a computer science Master's student at the University of Michigan. My research focus is at the intersection between Machine Learning, Computational Neuroscience, and Mathematics. Currently, I am working in the lab of [Cynthia Chestek](https://chestekresearch.engin.umich.edu), on models of neural stability for decoding in real-time systems. 

I like to write software. I have interned at [Alberta Health Services](https://www.albertahealthservices.ca), where I worked on an ML backend for a [brain-controlled music creation application](https://github.com/GRH-BCI/BCI-Beats-Forked) for patients with motor disabilities. I have also interned at [Synchron](https://synchron.com), working on software and firmware for a state-of-the-art endovascular brain-computer interface.

Previously, I graduated with my BSc from the University of Alberta, where I majored in Computer Science and minored in Mathematics.
